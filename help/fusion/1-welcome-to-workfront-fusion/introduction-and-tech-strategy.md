# Introduction to Fusion

Learn about the power and flexibility of [!DNL Adobe Workfront Fusion], and how to get started using your own Fusion instance.

## What is Adobe Workfront Fusion?

Workfront Fusion is a powerful integration platform that lets work flow freely across systems and teams. Its role is to automate your processes so that you can concentrate on new tasks rather than repeating the same tasks again and again. It works by linking actions within and between apps and services to create a scenario that transfers and transforms your data automatically.

## How to get Fusion

Fusion is an add-on product included in some Workfront packages and not in others. If your Workfront package does not include Fusion contact sales.

## Get started using Fusion

In order to do anything in Fusion you need to be on a team within an organization. Your Fusion system administrator will create teams in your organization and invite users to be on one or more teams.

Your Fusion system administrator will send you a new user invitation, which will consist of two emails. When you've received both emails follow the instructions in [Log in as a new user](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/workfront-learn/tutorials-workfront/fusion/welcome-to-workfront-fusion/log-in-as-a-new-user.html?lang=en).

If you're the Fusion system administrator you'll want to consult the following tutorials to learn how to create teams and add new users.
